    "In this assignment we have implemented a call center simulation. System consists of two M/M/1 queues put one after another. Clients place a call to front desk operator who then further forwards them to an expert operator. Clients may renage after front desk operator while waiting for expert, expert takes a break sometimes and both queues are FCFS. Exact details of both queues can be found in assignment description."
